# Z70 Assembler
Z70 is a hypothetical computer architecture that was inspired on x86, but simplified. It is used at UCS "Fundamentals of Computer Architecture" classes.
The goal here is to create an assembler for the Z70 ISA, making easier for students and professor to write code, which can run on the Z70 emulator [available here](https://github.com/rafael-graunke/z70-emulator).
